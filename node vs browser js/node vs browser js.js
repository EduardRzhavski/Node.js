// What are 3 things node.js has that the client side javascript doesn’t
// have. And the reasons why.

// 1. Server-Side Execution:

// Node.js allows JavaScript to build server applications and handle server-related tasks, like file operations, networking and database interactions while JavaScript primarily runs in web browsers, focusing on interfaces, events and manipulating the DOM.

// 2. File System Access:

// Node.js provides the interact with the file system on the server, allowing applications reading configuration files, logging, and serving static assets while JavaScript primarily has limited access to the local file system.

// 3. Module System (CommonJS):

// Node.js uses the CommonJS module system, modularization of code through mechanisms like require and module while JavaScript primarily lacked native support for modules.


// What are 3 things the client side javascript has that node.js doesn’t
// have. And the reasons why


// 1. DOM Manipulation:

// JavaScript in browser environment, has direct access to DOM, allowing it to manipulate and interact with the structure and content of HTML documents enables dynamic updates to the user interface and facilitates responsiveness while Node.js don't have direct access to the DOM.

// 2. Browser Events:

// JavaScript in browser can respond to events triggered by user interactions, like clicks, key presses, form submissions while Node.js doesn't have direct access to browser-specific events.

// 3.Window and Browser-Specific APIs:

// JavaScript has access to the window object and browser-specific APIs, like localStorage and fetch APIs that provide functionalities like managing browser storage, making HTTP requests, and interacting with the browser environment while Node.js doesn't have access to the window object or browser-specific APIs. Instead, Node.js provides its own set of APIs for tasks.
